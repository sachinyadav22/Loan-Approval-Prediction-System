# Loan-Approval-Prediction-System

## Introduction
With the use of machine learning methods, notably the Random Forest Classification model, the Loan Approval Prediction System was created as a potent tool to assist you in making judgments regarding your loan applications. This approach is intended to offer you precise estimates of the likelihood that your loan application will be approved.
